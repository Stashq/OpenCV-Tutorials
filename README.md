# OpenCV

## Showing images

If you plot image with `plt.imshow(img)`, it could change color scale and the result will be different than real.  

```python
cv2.waitKey(0)  # wait until any key has been pushed
cv2.waitKey(5000)  # wait 5sec or until any key has been pushed
cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # close all windows
```
